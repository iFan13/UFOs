# UFOs Webpage & Dynamic Table

## Overview

This project demonstrates the usage of javascript, html and github pages functionality. A template webpage is used as a base where a script is embedded that allows for dynamic updates of the UFO sightings table. The table is able to be filtered by multiple criteria dynamically on the webpage- specifically, by the event date, city, state, country and shape of the event.
